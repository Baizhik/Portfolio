                        <p>He's one of the most important people in my life, and honestly,
                            I feel incredibly lucky to have him. He’s the kind of person who shows love not just through words but through actions whether it's staying up late helping me with something, or just being there, quietly supporting me when I need it most.
                            Growing up, I always looked up to him. He’s this strong, steady presence, the person I could count on no matter what. He never wavers, even when things get tough, and that’s taught me so much about resilience and facing life’s challenges.
                             And it's not just that he's hardworkinghe's kind, patient, and has this way of making everything feel okay, even when it’s not.</p>

                        <h2>Gulmira Tlebaeva</h2>
                        <p>When I think of my mother, the first thing that comes to mind is her incredible strength. She's the backbone of our family, the person who holds everything together with grace and love.
                             Growing up, I watched her manage so much without ever complaining, and that taught me what it means to be selfless.I am who I am today largely because of her. 
                            There’s no way I could ever repay her for all that she’s done, but I hope she knows just how much I appreciate and love her. My mom is not just my guide; she’s my inspiration, my heart, and someone I look up to every single day.</p>

                        <h2>Baubekova Aliya</h2>
                        <p>My sister, Aliya, is truly one of a kind. Growing up with her has been one of the greatest gifts in my life. She's not just my sibling she's my closest friend, my confidante, and someone who understands me in ways no one else can.
                        What I admire most about Aliya is her spirit. She's so full of life, and her energy is contagious. She’s always had this natural ability to light up any room she walks into, making everyone around her feel comfortable and seen. 
                        Whether we're laughing about something silly or having deep, meaningful conversations, she has a way of bringing out the best in me.
                        Having her as my sister is something I’ll forever be grateful for. She’s more than family to me she’s someone I admire, someone who always makes me proud.
